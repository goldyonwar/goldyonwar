# 👋 Hi, I'm Gold Yon War
### Senior Android Software Engineer | Mobile Systems & BLE Specialist  
Auckland, New Zealand • Open to Remote / Hybrid / On-Site

I’m a Senior Android Software Engineer with over a decade of experience building
high-quality, user-centric mobile applications across Android, iOS, and cross-platform
ecosystems. My work spans Bluetooth (BLE) communication, OTA firmware update systems,
Kotlin Multiplatform, Jetpack Compose, SwiftUI, Flutter, AWS cloud services, and
full-stack engineering for production platforms.

I recently completed my Master of Information Sciences (IT) with Distinction at
Massey University, where I focused on data-driven system design, congestion prediction
modelling, and advanced location-based analytics.
