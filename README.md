# 👋 Hi, I'm Gold Yon War
### Senior Android Software Engineer | BLE Connectivity • OTA Systems • Cross-Platform Mobile Apps
Auckland, New Zealand • Open to Remote / Hybrid / On-Site

I’m a Senior Android Software Engineer with over a decade of experience designing and delivering
high-quality mobile applications across Android, iOS, and cross-platform ecosystems. My work
focuses on BLE/Bluetooth communication, custom SDK development, OTA firmware update systems,
device ecosystem integrations, and modern Android frameworks including Jetpack Compose and
Kotlin Multiplatform.

I also bring full-stack experience (Flask, PostgreSQL, React, AWS) and research expertise in
transport analytics, congestion prediction, and data-driven system design gained through my
Master of Information Sciences (Distinction) from Massey University.
